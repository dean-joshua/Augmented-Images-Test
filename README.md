# Overview

This is my first attempt at an Augmented Images Project with Google's ARCore in Android Studio.I 
have always been interested in Augmented Reality projects and this seemed like a very easy way to 
begin the journey. The developer.android website has really great resources and tutorials that helped
me to create this project.The project takes an image and overlays a maze on it and then places a 
spaceship in the maze that can be moved around it.
